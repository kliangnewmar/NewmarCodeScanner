Update SDK:
1. npm install
2. npm i -g expo-cli
3. expo-cli upgrade
4. npx expo install --fix
5. npx expo-doctor 
6. expo login
   username: kliangnewmar
   password: newmarexpo
7. expo publish -- will be deprecated after 2024-02-12

Note: SDK49 keeps crashing, so I have installed SDK48 to newmarscanner and SDK47 to scanner2 project for backup in SDK48 branch.
Master branch is for SDK49.
